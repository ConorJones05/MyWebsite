Here is the deployed link: https://conor-jones-personal-website.vercel.app/

What I still want to add/changes I want to make: Page dedicated to proven communcation ie https://conorjones05.github.io/comm/comm.html Make better ChatBot cheaper aswell Make more sections about projects Fix y/n issue used to work but now is broken

Thigns I would do diffrently from start: Read the docs before starting, struggled with cobbling together snippits of code found online and actualy buidling somthing with them Make more compents so doc was better to read. Everything sould be spilt more Build a the minimum then build up instead of getting bogged down with the cool stuff first ie the chatbot

Things that went well Learned about creation POST, GET and, fetch Learned about WebHooks (learned how much I dont know) Writeing interfaces was very good and actauly making try catch blocks for the API was persoanly achiving as I am applying whats learned in class
